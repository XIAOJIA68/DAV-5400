# what interests you in the data set?

# At first, I think the topic is very funny. Trump is always a popular person in our daily conversation and some of his policies may affect our life, so I’d like to analyze his approval rate. What’s more, I think this data set is really an excellent example to present data visualization. What I appreciate more is that it uses lots of icons to choose the information we want and avoids superfluous part, so the data set looks very straightforward. In addition, the movable line in the chart is very helpful to get the explicit value.
