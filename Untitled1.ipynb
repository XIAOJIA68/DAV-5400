For example, if your research questions are focused on a health related issue, you might provide a brief summary of how many people are affected by that issue each year either regionally, nationally or globally, including any infection rate or mortality statistics you were able to gather. Basically, in the Introduction you are trying to make the reader understand why the research questions you are going to propose are relevant and should be of interest to them.*\n",

So are you interested in the income and expenditure in NY? This data reasarch explore the range of personal income in NY, the different income between different jobs and which job has the highest avarage salary?And we can also know the difference of income between male and female. For the consumption, we are interested in the level of consumption, the total living expenditure in New York such as the house, transportation, daily meal expense. Finally, we get the information for the life in New York.\n",

Explain what types of statistical analysis you plan to utilize to help answer your research questions. Explain any graphics you plan to generate to help answer you research questions, e.g., \"..we will attempt to construct geoplots that will show how xxxxxx varies between counties within the state of Nevada..\", etc. The reader should come away with a clear understanding of how you plan to proceed with your work. Keep in mind that since this is a proposal, you need to be able to convince the reader that your proposed project is: a) realistic; and b) feasible within the time alloted for the project.*"
