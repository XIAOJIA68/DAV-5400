What’s more, I think this data set is really an excellent example to present data visualization. What I appreciate more is that it uses lots of icons to choose the information we want and avoids superfluous part, so the data set looks very straightforward. In addition, the movable line in the chart is very helpful to get the explicit value.\n",
